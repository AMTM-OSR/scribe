Completing this README is obviously on my ToDo list ...

One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Built With

* [vim](https://www.vim.org/) - because vi is always there, so I'm not lost on a clean install.

## Contributing

This has been a learning project for me, so I'm probably more married to my way of doing things than I should be.  Not to say suggestions aren't appreciated - they are and will be considered; but they are likely to be altered to my way of thinking about things if I add them, even if your way is clearly better.

## Authors

"Success has many fathers, but failure is a bastard child."

This isn't high school, it's all open book and copying from your neighbor is encouraged.  All the good bits I stole from someone else, all the crap bits and errors are mine.

## Acknowledgments

* RMerlin, for enduring an endless stream of people who will not read the release notes (out of his control), yet is still dedicated to producing the awesomeness that is AsusWRT-Merlin in what used to be known as his "free time".
* The great coders of SNB Forums, in alphabetical order, for lack of a better system:
    * Adamm
    * Jack Yaz
    * kvic
    * Odkrys
    * thelonelycoder
    * Xentrk

* Template used for thie README shamelessly stolen from [PurpleBooth](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2)

Are you really still reading this?  I'd have probably lost interest about halfway through.
