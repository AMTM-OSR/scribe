Completing this README is obviously on my ToDo list ...

One Paragraph of project description goes here

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Built With

* vim

## Contributing

You probably know way more about how this stuff works than I do.  Don't just send code, explain it to me.  Coding isn't my day job, be gentle.  :-)

## Authors

"Success has many fathers, but failure is a bastard child."

This isn't high school, it's all open book and copying from your neighbor is encouraged.  All the good bits I stole from someone else, all the errors are mine.

## Acknowledgments
