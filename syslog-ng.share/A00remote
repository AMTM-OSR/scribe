# send _ALL_ messages to a remote logging facility; it is recommended to set the remote log
# server here instead of in syslog-ng.conf if you are using this method to keep all remote
# information in one file - if you do set the log_server destination in syslog-ng.conf, 
# you will need to comment out the three lines here that define it
#
# it is strongly recommended to use IP addresess instead of hostnames for the destination
# server, as logging will stall if the nameserver is unavailable
#
# the following definition will send messages to a remote syslog-ng server in RFC 3164 (BSD / legacy) format
# RFC 3164 will be compatibile with a wider range of syslog servers

destination log_server { udp("192.168.x.y" port(514)); };

# the alternate definition below will send messages to a remote server in RFC 5424 (IETF) format,
# to use this format, comment out the above log_server definition and uncomment the one below
# for this defintion, the default transport protocol is tcp, and the default port is 601
# trasport protocal and port may be changed, and TLS encryption may be used; see the manual

#destination log_server { syslog("10.1.2.3"); };
