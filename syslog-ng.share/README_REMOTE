Readme for remote logging

This file contains basic instructions for setting up remote logging with
syslog-ng.  Exhaustive instructions on setting up remote logging are beyond
the scope of this README, however this README presents two options for 
remote logging; namely, either logging _ALL_ messages to the remote logging
facility, or only some.


Logging all messages remotely:

    Copy the A00remote file from /opt/share/syslog-ng/examples to
    /opt/etc/syslog-ng.d.  You will need to edit the A00remote file
    to point to the IP of your remote log server.  Do not rename
    this file or some messages may not be sent to the remote server.


Logging only some messages remotely:

    Do not copy the A00remote file, instead uncomment the log_server
    destination section (3 lines) from /opt/etc/syslog-ng.conf.
    Uncomment the 'destination(log_server);' line in that file to
    send all messages that would end up in the messages file to
    the remote server.  Copy the 'destination(log_server);' line
    to the log section of any filer in /opt/etc/syslog-ng.d that
    you wish to send those messages to the remote server.  It is
    recommended to copy the line either just before or just after
    the existing 'destination(d_xxxxx);' line in that file.


Please see the documentation for your remote log server for setup details
for your remote log server.  Again, it is beyond the scope (or ability)
of this documentation to provide instructions on setting up your remote
log server.
